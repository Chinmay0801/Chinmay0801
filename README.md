I am a curious and driven Computer Science undergraduate with a strong focus on software development, front-end engineering, and embedded systems. I enjoy building practical, user-centric solutions that combine clean UI design, efficient backend logic, and solid problem-solving fundamentals. My interests lie in full-stack web development, AI-integrated applications, and microcontroller-based systems.

I have hands-on experience developing full-stack applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. My projects include a Library Management System for handling book records, members, and issue/return workflows, an Expense Tracker that provides categorized spending insights and monthly summaries, and MindSpace, an AI-powered mental wellness platform featuring a chatbot and secure user data management. These projects strengthened my understanding of RESTful APIs, database design, and scalable application architecture.

Alongside web development, I have worked on embedded systems projects such as a Digital Temperature Monitoring system using the LPC1768 microcontroller with LM35 sensor integration, and a console-based 15-piece sliding puzzle game implemented in C. I am continuously improving my skills in Java, Python, C/C++, OOP, DBMS, DSA, and system-level programming, and I enjoy collaborating in team-based environments. I am actively seeking opportunities to grow as a Software Development Intern or Frontend Engineering Intern while building impactful, real-world solutions.
